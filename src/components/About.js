                <p>I'm a french pixel and furry artist.
                I've always designed characters, since my childhood. And it has never left me!
                I have a taste for cyberpunk / steampunk / retrofuturistic aesthetics.
                I work mainly on Aseprite and CLIP STUDIO PAINT, sometimes on Krita.
                You can find here some of my arts I'm proud of. Hope you enjoy!</p>

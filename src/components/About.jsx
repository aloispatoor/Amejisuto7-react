                    My name is Alo√Øs, I'm a <strong>french pixel and furry artist</strong>.
                    I've always designed characters, since my childhood. And it has never left me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a taste for <strong>cyberpunk / steampunk / retrofuturistic aesthetics</strong>.
                    I work mainly on Aseprite and CLIP STUDIO PAINT, sometimes on Krita.
                    You can find here some of my arts I'm proud of. Hope you enjoy!
